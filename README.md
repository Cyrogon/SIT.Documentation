# Stay In Tarkov Documentation
 
This is the Stay In Tarkov documentation Repo, if you're looking for the docs, go here: https://docs.stayintarkov.com/

# Contributing

If you wish to contribute, the easier way is by using Visual Studio Code, and the extension "Run on Save" by emeraldwalk, found [here.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave) And open the workspace file, doing so will have the clear and build command run every time you save, making changes much easier and quicker to see.

# Without Extension

If you don't use VSCode or don't want an external extension, you can run the make.bat with the args `clean` and `html` to clear the build folder then build the docs again.

# Localisation

If you want to help localise Stay In Tarkov, check if the langauge you want to translate is already there, under the Locales folder. If it is you can edit the .po files and make a push request when done, otherwise you'll need to let someone in the Discord know so we can add it.

* If you know how to use Sphinx and Sphinx-Intl to make locale files from the build, you can pull this project and make the locales yourself.
