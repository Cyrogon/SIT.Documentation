Welcome to Stay In Tarkov!
===================================

**Stay In Tarkov (SIT)** is a Escape From Tarkov mod designed for cooperative play (coop with your friends). SIT uses
modding frameworks such as BepInEx and Single Player Tarkov (SPT) to achieve its goal.

Stay In Tarkov is currently under development by a small team of developers. While SIT is playable, there are many bugs, synchronization and performance issues during gameplay.
Escape From Tarkov and Single Player Tarkov updates frequently and oftentimes, your progress must be reset.

In other words, SIT is not a perfect replacement of the live experience. **Please keep in mind that game breaking bugs and progression issues may occur.**

.. note::
   SIT is NOT an attempt to provide an alternative to the live experience of Escape From Tarkov. The primary goal is 
   to enable playing Escape From Tarkov with friends and AI (bots). Consequently, no efforts are planned to make SIT into a fully secure headless dedicated server, 
   and it is highly unlikely that such efforts will ever be made.
