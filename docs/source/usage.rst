**NOTE:** After copying the Escape From Tarkov files, you should **NOT** touch the live version of EFT again.

Prerequisites
=============
Escape from Tarkov must be up to date and **RUN THE GAME AT LEAST ONCE**.

Install Steps
=============

1. Download the latest SIT Manager from the `SIT.Manager releases <https://github.com/stayintarkov/SIT.Manager/releases/latest/download/SIT.Manager.zip>`_.

2. Create a new folder named SIT to house your 'Game' and 'Launcher' folders.

3. Inside the SIT folder, create two more folders named 'Game' and 'Launcher'. Your folder structure should resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   SIT/
   ├── Game/
   └── Launcher/

4. Copy all files from your 'live' Escape From Tarkov folder to your 'Game' folder.

5. Download the latest downgrader from the provided link.

6. After downloading, extract the contents so that 'patcher.exe' and 'AKI_Patches' are in the 'Game' directory.

.. note:: Run 'patcher.exe' and **WAIT** for it to complete. It will prompt you when finished. It's normal for the 'Aki_Patches' folder to be deleted during the downgrade process.

7. Next, extract the 'SIT.Manager.zip' and copy its contents to the 'Launcher' folder.

8. Start the launcher by running the 'SIT.Manager.exe' file located in your 'Launcher' directory.

9. In the SIT.Manager, set the EFT Path to your copied and patched EFT files in the 'Game' folder.

.. note:: Select 'Settings', click 'Change' for 'EFT Path' setting, and select your 'SIT/Game' folder.

10. Select the 'Tools' menu and click 'Install SIT'. The launcher will download the latest release of SIT.

11. Make sure to select the version of SIT that matches your version of EFT. 

.. note:: Look at the 'Product version' in the 'Details' pane of 'EscapeFromTarkov.exe' properties to find your version.

12. After installation, obtain the server IP from your host and enter it in the 'Play' tab along with a username and password. Select 'Remember Me' and click 'Connect'.
